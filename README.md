# Asteroids
Just the Asteroids game made with JavaScript. I made this to take a break from learning React for about 3 weeks. The main challenges I faced when making this project was how to calculate the positioning of the projectiles based on the spaceship's X & Y position, as well as the angle of the tip of the spaceship. Another challenge was the balancing of the game difficulty, I had to watch for the projectile speed & size, max distance it can travel, and the speed & size of the asteroids themselves. Even so, I had fun making this.

I used this tutorial as a [foundation/reference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iO8ai6LU0s6aHAaWP4RAkF) for the game.
## Improvements to be made (hopefully):
<ul>
  <li>QuadTree for hit detection for asteroids</li>
  <li>Improve hit detection for asteroids against player</li>
  <li>Vector mathematics for coordinates, distance & velocity -> gl-matrix?? </li>
  <li>Improve FPS calculation for FPS limiter</li>
  <li>Further code optimizations</li>
  <li>Modularize code</li>
  <li><strike>Fix slider thumb styling for Chromium based browsers</strike></li>
  <li><strike>Pause menu...?</strike></li>
</ul>
