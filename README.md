# Asteroids
The Asteroids game made with JavaScript. I made this to take a break from learning React for about 3 weeks. 
<br>
I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iO8ai6LU0s6aHAaWP4RAkF) as a foundation/reference when making the game.

## Challenges Faced
<ul>
  <li>Balancing the game's difficulty</li>
</ul>

## Potential Improvements
<ul>
  <li>QuadTree for hit detection for asteroids</li>
  <li>Improve hit detection for asteroids against player</li>
  <li>Vector mathematics for coordinates, distance & velocity -> gl-matrix?? </li>
  <li>Further code optimizations</li>
  <li>Modularize code</li>
  <li><strike>Fix slider thumb styling for Chromium based browsers</strike></li>
  <li><strike>Pause menu...?</strike></li>
</ul>
